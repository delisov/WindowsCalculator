# Windows Calculator Clone C# WPF MVVM 
Just a very thorough clone of Windows calculator with C# WPF MVVM 


Hi!

As a part of a test task for one of prospective employers I did this thoroughly copied Windows Calculator. Amount of time and energy consumed requires me to share this openly with the world :)

It's MIT license, so feel free to use it for any commercial or non-commercial projects

Features:
* Aero Glass Background (called Acrylic in Windows 10)
* Adaptive layout (custom visibility of grid on resize)
* Reveal effect on buttons
* WindowChrome with custom buttons
* Binding of all the texts, so it's ready for globalization
* Just a working calculator!

Credits:
* Glass effect, reveal effect, WindowChrome (infinite kudos!) was used from https://github.com/sourcechord/FluentWPF. Just a single showcase app that saved kilotons of hours!
* Stackoveflow, obviously
